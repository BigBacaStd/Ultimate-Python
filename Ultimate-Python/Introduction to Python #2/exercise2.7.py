"""
Write and execute a script which request user the user to input an integer number
representing a year. Then, the script has to find out which the closest leap year
following the one specified by the user. In case the user actually inputs a leap year,
it would bethe solution for the request.

Example: If the year inputs by the user is 1992 or 1993 the solution is '1992' or '1996', respectively.
